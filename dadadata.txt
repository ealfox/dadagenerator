CHANGE THIS TEXT TO WHATEVER YOU WANT. THIS IS WHAT YOUR POEM WILL BE GENERATED FROM.

A simple program for generating dadaist poems. Sometimes manages to even make a rhyme.

This started as a literature homework. The task was to bring some newspaper to school so we can try to create a dada poem using cut out words. But seriously, who reads newspaper in 21st century? I didn't have any, I always read news online. So... Improvise. Adapt. Overcome. Created a really simple program that was randomly choosing words from an article and put it into something looking like a poem. Later I worked a bit more and added randomness to more factors (since dadaism should be random), the possibility to set the number of stanzas/verses/words (but lol, you won't affect the final result that much) and also the rhyme feature.

Whatever you want your poem to be generated from (should be a text, the longer the better the chances of getting some cool stuff), put it into the txt doc called "dadadata" (or anything else but don't forget to change the code).

Not sure about the results in different languages. Rhymes are created by words with the same last two letters here, it works fine in my native language but english has different pronounciation and it most likely won't be that good. But seriously who cares, it's dada, it doesn't need rhymes.
